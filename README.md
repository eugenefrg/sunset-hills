# Coding Challenge: Sunset Valley

**Introduction**
this is a personal challenge for myself, and I found this challenge somewhere (I actually lost the link) in YouTube.
The rules of this is that there is a set of columns, and the sun is setting in the west. 

**Why**
after years of deleting everything I make on GitHub because of being ashamed of what it looks like, I am going to change my ways. My mindset was that I have to be putting out things as perfect, but now I believe I can just keep updating this as if it was a seed, and that it will grow eventually to be a beautiful plant
